# CNN-image-classification-CIFAR-10-
This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The goal of the project is to build and train an end-to-end deep learning pipeline from scratch covering data loading augmentation model design training validation and evaluation.

The model incorporates standard best practices for image classification including data augmentation batch normalisation and regularisation. Training is monitored using a validation set with early stopping to prevent overfitting and to demonstrate principled model selection rather than aggressive benchmark chasing.

The repository is designed to be clean readable and reproducible making it suitable as a reference implementation for CNN training workflows as well as a foundation for further experimentation and tuning.
