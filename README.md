# CNN-image-classification-CIFAR-10-
This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The goal of the project is to build and train an end-to-end deep learning pipeline from scratch, covering data loading, augmentation, model design, training, validation, and evaluation.
